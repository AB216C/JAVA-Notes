    //Public void

    //Accessible by other classes
    //No static: This is an instance method
    //void: No return of value


    //Void only

    //You can not use void only in method declaration in java
    //You need to specify at least the access modifier(public, private, etc)


    //Why does Java have public class and main method

    //public class and main method are the entry point for most java applications

    //Java requires that each file contain at most one public class
