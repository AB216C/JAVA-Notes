/*

Purpose of Exception Handling:

Prevents Program Crashes: Without exception handling, errors would cause your program to stop suddenly.
Handling exceptions keeps the program running.
Keeps Code Clean: By separating error-handling code from regular code, it makes your program easier to read and maintain.
Improves Debugging: By catching exceptions, you can get detailed messages about what went wrong, helping you fix bugs.
Allows for Recovery: Your program can recover from minor issues and continue to function.

Common Exception Classes:

NullPointerException: Occurs when you try to use a null object.
ArithmeticException: Happens when you try to divide by zero.
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: Occurs when you try to access an array element that doesn’t exist.
ClassCastException: Happens when you try to cast an object to a class it doesn’t belong to.
