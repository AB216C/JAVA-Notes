    /*
    Without any protection of this class, here are our main cons:
        No Control Over Data: Fields can be modified directly, which might lead to invalid states or inconsistencies.
        No Validation: There’s no way to enforce rules for setting values (e.g., ensuring age is non-negative).
        Reduced Maintainability: Any changes to fields or requirements might necessitate changes across many places in the code.
