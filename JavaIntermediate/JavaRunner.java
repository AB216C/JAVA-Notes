        //POTENTIAL ISSUES:

        /*
        On its own, this is a pretty unsafe thing to do.
        If you gave someone access to this code base, you are saying they can modify the variables to be whatever they want.
        Imagine if they tried setting age to a negative number, or created a name with over 1000 characters??
        Weâ€™ll learn how to protect our class variables with encapsulation at some point soon.
