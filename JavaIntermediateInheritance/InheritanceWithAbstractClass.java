/*
Abstract Classes/Methods
An abstract class in Java is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and is designed to be extended by other classes.
It can contain abstract methods, which are method declarations without implementations.
Subclasses of an abstract class must provide concrete implementations for these abstract methods.
The purpose of abstract classes is to serve as blueprints for other classes, guiding their structure.
Since abstract methods must be overridden, they cannot be marked as private or final.
