/*
What if we wanted to define a purely abstract class with only abstract methods?
There's a convenient way to do that! An interface in Java defines a set of methods that a class must implement, without providing default implementations (unless using default methods).
All members of an interface are implicitly public.
Interfaces can include abstract methods, default methods, static methods, and static final variables, which allow for a flexible blueprint for classes to follow while maintaining certain constants or utility methods.

Abstract Method: A method with no implementation in the interface. Classes implementing the interface must provide the method's body.
Static Method: A method that belongs to the interface itself, not the implementing classes. It can have an implementation and is called using the interface name.
Default Method: A method in an interface with a default implementation. Implementing classes can use it as-is or override it.
Static Final Variable: A constant in an interface. It must be initialized when declared and cannot be changed. It is shared across all implementations.
